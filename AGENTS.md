# AGENTS.md

Project-local guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Product Goal

CodeForge is a Windows Tauri desktop app in the same broad category as Codex Desktop and Claude Desktop, but with a narrower product scope:

- Focus on coding workflows only.
- Make the agent process fully transparent through trace UI.
- Show how model calls, tool calls, skills, MCP-style integrations, and local IDE actions are invoked.
- Prefer an inspectable engineering tool over a general chat assistant.

The current development focus is tool-calling experiments. Treat trace quality as product behavior, not as debug-only output.

## Agent Safety Policy

The project agent is a code editing assistant only. It may search files and code, read workspace files, analyze code, modify code, apply patches, show diffs, and read IDE/compiler/linter diagnostics when available.

Do not automatically execute scripts, shell commands, installers, package managers, build commands, test commands, deploy commands, or unsafe tools. Do not run `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.ps1`, `.sh`, `.exe`, `.msi`, or similar files. Do not use generic shell tools such as `execute_command`, `run_shell`, `terminal`, or `powershell`. Do not install packages, download and execute scripts, or access files outside the workspace.

If build or test support is needed later, implement explicit safe tools such as `build_solution` or `run_tests` with fixed command templates, workspace confinement, trace output, and user confirmation. Do not expose arbitrary shell execution.

## Architecture Boundaries

- React owns UI rendering and calls typed Tauri commands from `src/api/tauriApi.ts`.
- Rust owns local state, settings, providers, agent runs, tool execution, trace creation, Visual Studio launch, VS bridge registration, and code-link resolution.
- Keep tool definitions and tool execution server-side unless a feature is clearly UI-only.
- Do not put secret values into traces. Mask API keys and other credentials.
- Browser-only Vite mode (`npm run dev`) is for frontend layout work only. Tauri commands require `npm run tauri dev` or a built desktop app.

Useful entry points:

```text
src-tauri\src\agent_runner.rs
src-tauri\src\tool_registry.rs
src-tauri\src\tool_trace.rs
src-tauri\src\commands.rs
src\components\TraceDrawer.tsx
src\components\TraceEventRow.tsx
src\components\traceViewModel.ts
src\types\trace.ts
src\api\tauriApi.ts
```

## Product Direction

CodeForge is a local C++ / Visual Studio coding agent with VSIX semantic integration, workspace cache, build-error repair loop, and traceable tool execution.

Do not treat this as a generic chat wrapper. The product advantage should be C++ / Visual Studio project understanding:

- Current solution, project, active document, and selection.
- Symbol definitions and references.
- Caller/callee and override information.
- Project-to-file ownership.
- Active build configuration.
- Compiler error context.
- Clickable code links back into Visual Studio.
- Tool execution trace and token usage.

## Trace Rules

Trace is the main product surface.

- Every meaningful agent step should be represented as a trace event.
- Tool calls must show tool name, input arguments, result or error, status, and duration when available.
- LLM calls must show request/response shape, model/provider, token usage, and cache usage when reported by the provider.
- If adding skills, MCP servers, or external adapters, model them as traceable steps instead of hidden side effects.
- Keep raw payload access available when possible, but summarize important fields for quick reading.
- Prefer adding explicit trace data over inferring from rendered text.
- Failed tool/model steps should be visible as failed trace events, not hidden behind a generic chat error.

## Tool And Skill Experiments

- The current tool-call test path is intentional. Preserve it as a small, inspectable workflow while tool calling is being evaluated.
- Keep demo tools small and deterministic unless the user asks for real external integration.
- When adding a new tool, define its schema, execution, trace event shape, and UI summary together.
- When testing MCP/skill-like behavior, make the adapter boundary explicit: what input is sent, what output comes back, what failed, and how long it took.
- Do not add broad automation or multi-domain assistant features unless they directly support coding workflow traceability.

## Planned Semantic VSIX Tools

The current bridge opens files. The next stage is to expose semantic C++ project tools from Visual Studio:

```text
vs.current_solution
vs.current_document
vs.current_selection
vs.list_projects
vs.list_project_files
vs.find_definition
vs.find_references
vs.get_error_list
```

Later tools may include:

```text
vs.find_callers
vs.find_callees
vs.find_overrides
vs.find_derived_classes
vs.get_build_configuration
vs.prepare_context
```

The VSIX should remain a semantic bridge. Model orchestration, task planning, patching, trace storage, token accounting, and provider configuration belong in the Desktop / Agent Host side.

## Coding Rules

- Keep changes surgical. Do not refactor adjacent UI or Rust modules unless the requested change needs it.
- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Maintain typed data flow across Rust structs, Tauri command outputs, TypeScript types, and React view models.
- If changing trace event payloads, update all affected layers in the same change.
- Keep UI dense and utilitarian. This app is a workbench, not a landing page.
- Do not silently remove existing trace detail to simplify a new view.
- Prefer patch-based edits over full-file rewrites.
- Keep model orchestration outside the VSIX.
- Treat Visual Studio / clangd / project files as the source of truth.

## Verification

Use the smallest safe check that proves the change. By default, prefer static review, diffs, and existing IDE/compiler/linter diagnostics. Do not run build, test, or dev-server commands automatically; use explicit safe tools with user confirmation if they are added later.

## Reporting

When reporting code locations to the user, use copyable Visual Studio style:

```text
src\components\TraceDrawer.tsx:130
src-tauri\src\agent_runner.rs:249
```

Summarize:

- Changed: file -> behavior changed.
- Validation: command -> result.
- Notes: remaining risk or what was not exercised.
